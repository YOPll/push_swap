# Introduction to Push_swap
Push_swap is a School 42 project. The purpose of this project is to create sorting algorithm.


## About
The purpose of this project is to make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, usingthe lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for anoptimized data sorting.

[SUBJECT](Subject/en.subject.pdf)

| instructions  | Description   |
|:-------------:|---------------|
| sa            | swap first two elements of stack A |
| sb            | swap first two elements of stack B |
| ss            | sa and sb at the same time |
| pa            | pops the first elememt on B and puts it on top of A |
| pb            | pops the first elememt on A and puts it on top of B |
| ra            | rotates stuck A up by one|
| rb            | rotates stuck B up by one |
| rr            | rotates both A and B up by one |
| rra           | rotates stuck A down by one |
| rrb           | rotates stuck B down by one |
| rrr           | rotates both A and B down by one |

## USAGE
Run ```make```.

The **checker** program is used as follows:
```c
  ./checker 5 2 3 1 4
```
```c
  ./checker "-50 -400 -20 -1 -100"
```
```c
  ./checker "-22" "35" "40" "-15" "75"
```

The **push_swap** program is used in the same way
```c
  ./push_swap 5 2 3 1 4
```

You can run the two together using:
```c
  ARG=`ruby -e "puts (0..100).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"`; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker -v $ARG
```
- Enjoy results
